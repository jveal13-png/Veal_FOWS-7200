Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The image arrangement illustrates the relationship between the three key factors in epidemiology or disease transmission.

![1. Sample Size for 5% Prevalence, 95% Confidence, 5000 Deer](images/clipboard-1592867622.png)

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence with 95% confidence in a herd of 5000 deer is 82.

2\. Sample Size Comparisons (Hypergeometric, "Infinite" or Large Population)

a\) 95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 299.

b\) 99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 229.

3\. Interpreting a Sample of 300 Deer from 4000 (None Positive, 95% Confidence)

From the table (95% confidence, population size 4000):

\- Sampled: 300 deer, None positive.

\- For 1% prevalence, required sample: 118.

\- For 0.5% prevalence, required sample: 230.

Since 300 exceeds 118 but is just above 230, and all are negative, the maximum prevalence is \<0.5% (less than 0.5%) at 95% confidence.
