The image arrangement illustrates the relationship between the three key factors in epidemiology or disease transmission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![1. Sample Size for 5% Prevalence, 95% Confidence, 5000 Deer](images/clipboard-1592867622.png)

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence with 95% confidence in a herd of 5000 deer is 82.

2\. Sample Size Comparisons (Hypergeometric, "Infinite" or Large Population)

a\) 95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 299.

b\) 99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 229.

3\. Interpreting a Sample of 300 Deer from 4000 (None Positive, 95% Confidence)

From the table (95% confidence, population size 4000):

\- Sampled: 300 deer, None positive.

\- For 1% prevalence, required sample: 288

\- For 0.5% prevalence, required sample: 230.

Since 300 exceeds 288, and all are negative, the maximum prevalence is \<0.5% (less than 0.5%) at 95% confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

**Unit: Cases/population at risk (100 Elk per day)**

Incidence on **06/12/25**:

New cases: 5 Elk (2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B)

Population at risk: 51 Elk (56 total-5 cumulative cases on 06/11)

**Incidence Rate= 5/51= 0.09804 (9.8)**

Incidence on **06/14/25**:

New cases: 2 Elk (1766B, 4599B)

Population at risk: 44 Elk (56 total-12 cumulative cases on 06/13)

**Incidence Rate: 2/44= 0.04545 (4.5)**

Incidence on **06/15/25**:

New cases: 0 Elk

Population at risk: 42 Elk (56 total-14 cumulative cases on 06/14)

**Incidence Rate= 0/42= 0 (0)**

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 6/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit of prevalence.

Prevalence= (Total affected cases on day t / Total population on day t) x 100

Prevalence on 06/13/25:

Total affected cases (**I** 06/13):12 Elk (06/13)

Total Population(**N**): 56 Elk

**Prevalence: 12/56= 0.21428 (21.43% per 100)**

Prevalence on 06/16/25:

Total affected cases (06/16):5 Elk (06/13)

Total Population: 56 Elk

**Prevalence: 5/56= 0.08928 (8.93% per 100)**

c\) On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?

It is the same on the first day 06/10/25 so all new infection cases are new.

d\) On which day is the incidence the lowest?

The incidence rate is lowest on 06/15 and 06/16 since the new cases where at 0

Worksheet 4

1\. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

This is incorrect. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people, primarily from infected dromedary camels. Human-to-human transmission occurs only through close contact and has not sustained itself within human populations.

2\. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV  

This is correct. Dromedary camels are the primary reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV, shedding virus in nasal secretions and acting as the main source for zoonotic spillover.

3\. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV  

This is mostly correct. Phylogenetic and epidemiological data show that humans act as dead-end hosts, as transmission chains end quickly with no sustained community spread.

4\. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%  

This is incorrect. The actual case fatality rate averages about 35% worldwide, as reported by the WHO, CDC, and recent epidemiological analyses.

5\. The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak  

This is incorrect. MERS-CoV is characterized by repeated zoonotic spillovers from camels with limited human-to-human transmission, a propagated pattern rather than a single point source.

6\. Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019  

This is correct. Global MERS-CoV case reports have sharply decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to pandemic mitigation measures, reduced travel, and enhanced infection control. Additional factors may include changes in camel-human interaction and potential cross-immunity effects with SARS-CoV-2.

Worksheet 5

**Classification Under the Fenton and Pedersen Framework**

The Fenton and Pedersen community epidemiology framework classifies disease threats based on between- and within-species transmission rates, demarcating four categories: spillover, apparent multihost, true multihost, and potential emerging infectious disease.

Spillover event occurs when a pathogen occasionally transmits from a reservoir host, like bats, into a target population (humans), but cannot sustain human-to-human transmission:  R_0 \< 1 in humans.

Emerging infectious disease (EID) designation is warranted when, after initial spillover, sustained human-to-human transmission occurs within the target host (R_0 \> 1 in humans), resulting in broader community spread.

**Measures to Reduce Transmission Risk**

Contact tracing and isolation: Promptly trace contacts and isolate symptomatic individuals. 

Surveillance and diagnostics: Rapidly detect, test, and report cases. 

Vaccination/therapeutics: Use experimental vaccines or treatments under emergency protocols when available.

Healthcare Settings: Follow strict IPC measures, ensure staff training, maintain surge capacity with adequate supplies and advanced care, monitor healthcare workers for exposure, and establish safe patient movement protocols. Rwanda’s swift, evidence-based response—including IPC, vaccination trials, and health system mobilization—shows the effectiveness of these strategies for future filovirus outbreaks.

**Worksheet 7**

Nipah Virus—Malaysia vs. Bangladesh

In Malaysia, Nipah virus transmission primarily occurred from fruit bats to pigs, with humans infected by direct contact with infected pigs during farm operations or slaughter (Azri Bin Adzhar, 2011; NCBI, 2007). Minimal-to-no human-to-human transmission was observed (NCBI, 2007; CDA, 2025). In contrast, Bangladesh sees direct transmission from bats to humans, mainly via ingestion of raw date palm sap contaminated by bat saliva or urine (NCBI, 2007; CIDRAP, 2025). Significant human-to-human transmission has also been documented in Bangladesh, often through close contact with infected patients' secretions, especially saliva (NCBI, 2007; CIDRAP, 2025).

Preventive Measures: In Malaysia, controls focus on restricting pig movement, culling infected livestock, and improving farm biosecurity to limit bat–pig–human transmission (Azri Bin Adzhar, 2011; NCBI, 2007). In Bangladesh, strategies aim to minimize human exposure to contaminated palm sap (using collection covers, avoiding fresh sap consumption), encourage safe food handling, and isolate patients to limit person-to-person spread (NCBI, 2007; CIDRAP, 2025; WOAH, 2021).

Avian Reovirus

Avian reovirus (ARV) is transmitted both vertically (parent to offspring via eggs) and horizontally (bird-to-bird: fecal-oral, respiratory, contaminated feed/equipment) (ScienceDirect, 2025; Nature, 2016; GD Animal Health, n.d.). Environmental factors favoring ARV spread include high density, poor sanitation, contaminated surfaces/water, and stress—since the virus survives well on surfaces and in water (GD Animal Health, n.d.; ScienceDirect, 2025). ARV’s resilience in the environment, resistance to desiccation, and high shedding through feces support robust horizontal transmission (ScienceDirect, 2025; Nature, 2016; GD Animal Health, n.d.). A classic example is viral arthritis (tenosynovitis) in wild/domestic birds, causing lameness, joint swelling, reduced mobility, high mortality, and reduced egg production (Nature, 2016; PMC, 2022).

Langya Henipavirus (LayV)

The likely reservoir of Langya virus in China is shrews (genus Crocidura) with presumed animal-to-human transmission, likely via direct contact (PMC, 2022; Nature, 2025). Langya is classified as a spillover, not a potential EID, because all known human cases were directly traced to animal exposure and no sustained human-to-human transmission was observed (PMC, 2022; Nature, 2025).

**MEMO TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS**

Subject: New World Screwworm – Disease Overview and Public Health Recommendations

From: Joshua H. Veal

**Overview**

The New World Screwworm (NWS), caused by the parasitic fly Cochliomyia hominivorax, is an obligate parasite whose larvae induce myiasis by infesting living tissues of warm-blooded animals. While livestock are the primary hosts, birds, pets, and humans may also be affected, albeit rarely.\[2\]\[4\]

**Reservoir and Transmission**

Female NWS flies deposit eggs in open wounds or mucous membranes, with larvae rapidly burrowing into tissue and causing non-healing wounds. If untreated, infestations may lead to severe tissue damage and death. Mature larvae exit the host to pupate in soil, and the entire lifecycle can complete in under three weeks given suitable conditions. Major pathways for spread include livestock movement, animal husbandry, and human travel.\[3\]\[4\]\[6\]\[7\]\[8\]

**Geographic Distribution**

Once endemic throughout the Americas, NWS has been eradicated from the U.S. via the sterile insect technique (SIT) and ongoing surveillance. However, outbreaks persist in Central and South America, resulting in sporadic imported cases in North America—including the first U.S. human case in Maryland, August 2025, linked to travel from El Salvador. Counties adjacent to endemic regions remain at heightened risk due to animal movement and fly migration.\[3\]\[5\]\[6\]\[9\]\[10\]

**Clinical Presentation**

NWS myiasis typically presents as non-healing, foul-smelling wounds with visible larvae. In livestock, rapid tissue destruction can result in significant health and productivity losses. Human cases necessitate prompt clinical intervention—primarily mechanical removal of larvae—as no direct pharmacological treatments exist. Secondary bacterial infections are common and can worsen outcomes.\[2\]\[4\]

**Public Health Implications of Importation**

The recent Maryland case highlights the ongoing risk posed by international travel and trade. While surveillance suggests a low risk of domestic spread, an outbreak in U.S. livestock could incur substantial economic losses, with USDA estimates reaching \$1.8 billion for Texas alone during a large-scale infestation. Nevertheless, rigorous surveillance and rapid action are effective for containment; recent trapping data show no evidence of local transmission.\[5\]\[6\]

**Recommended Actions**

-   

-   Enhance Surveillance: Implement routine screening of imported animals and monitor for unexplained wounds in both animals and humans, prioritizing regions with high travel or proximity to endemic areas.\[6\]\[7\]

-   

-   Provider and Producer Education: Distribute updated guidance to clinicians, veterinarians, and ranchers on NWS recognition, case reporting, and wound management to prevent fly attraction and oviposition.\[2\]\[3\]

-   

-   Public Awareness: Initiate campaigns to encourage prompt reporting of suspect myiasis and reinforce best practices in wound care and animal handling, especially post-travel.\[8\]

-   

-   Case Management: Ensure immediate removal and identification of larvae, wound disinfection, and notification of authorities for confirmation and epidemiologic response. No medications are available for humans; use organophosphorus insecticides in animals only under veterinary supervision.\[4\]

-   

-   Infection Control: Establish protocols in healthcare settings for suspected NWS cases, safeguard healthcare personnel during wound care, and develop referral pathways for specialized myiasis management.\[2\]

-   

-   SIT and Biosecurity: Maintain sterile fly release programs and enforce animal transport biosecurity from endemic regions to prevent NWS reestablishment.\[4\]\[5\]

-   

**Ecological Considerations**

-   

-   Host-Pathogen Dynamics: NWS is highly adapted to livestock, relying on open wounds for lifecycle completion. The broad host range complicates eradication, especially in wildlife-abundant areas.\[4\]\[7\]

-   

-   Spillover Risk: Introduction to non-endemic zones occurs via movement of infected hosts and travelers, with suitable climates enabling rapid population growth. SIT disrupts fly reproduction, reducing infestation rates.\[4\]\[7\]

-   

-   Reservoir Management: NWS larvae do not persist long outside hosts, but asymptomatic carrier movement and poor wound care increase outbreak risk. Continuous vigilance at the wildlife-livestock-human interface is essential.\[1\]\[3\]

**Worksheet 9**

1\. Human behaviors and Salmonella spread

Risky practices included:

\- Handling poultry (especially chicks/ducklings) and then touching the mouth or eating without washing hands, which allows fecal Salmonella on skin or clothes to enter the oral route.

\- Allowing poultry (or their crates, bedding, or equipment) into homes, especially kitchens or areas where food is prepared or where young children play, which contaminates household surfaces and increases exposure for family members.

\- Letting children (particularly under 5 years) handle chicks or clean coops without strict hygiene, or supervising handwashing poorly, which is high risk because children are more likely to put contaminated hands or objects in their mouths and have higher susceptibility to severe infection.

Contributing behaviors often cited were:

\- Not washing hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching birds, eggs, coop surfaces, or used bedding, which leaves Salmonella on hands.

\- Eating or drinking in areas where poultry live or roam (e.g., snacking in the yard while handling birds), which makes it easier for bacteria on hands or dust to reach the mouth.

2a. Advantage of the endophyte to tall fescue

Infection with Epichloë coenophiala improves tall fescue’s persistence and stress tolerance. Endophyte-infected plants show better survival under drought, salinity, and other environmental stress, often with improved nutrient acquisition and root-soil interactions compared with endophyte-free fescue.

The endophyte also provides natural protection against insects and some herbivores via its alkaloid production, so infected tall fescue stands tend to be more productive and longer-lived in pastures than endophyte-free stands.

2b. Factors driving the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis

Both pasture conditions and management drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis:

\- Plant and alkaloid factors: High proportion of endophyte-infected tall fescue (especially cultivars like Kentucky-31) and high ergot-alkaloid concentrations in the forage, which can increase with plant maturity, seed-head presence, and specific fertilization regimes (e.g., high nitrogen).

\- Environmental conditions: Heat stress (warm, humid weather) worsens hyperthermia and performance losses, while cold stress (low temperatures, frost) promotes vasoconstriction-related problems like “fescue foot” and gangrene of extremities.

\- Grazing management and animal factors: Continuous grazing on heavily infected fescue, lack of forage diversity, high stocking rate, and susceptible classes (late-gestation or lactating cows, growing calves) increase cumulative exposure and clinical expression.

2c. Key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle

Typical clinical signs in affected cattle include:

\- Reduced feed intake, weight gain, milk production, and reproductive performance (e.g., poor conception, agalactia), reflecting chronic production losses.

\- Hyperthermia and heat stress behaviors in warm weather, such as elevated body temperature, rapid breathing (tachypnea), excessive salivation, rough hair coat, and seeking shade or water.

\- Cold extremities, lameness, and in severe cases dry gangrene of tails, ears, or distal limbs (“fescue foot”), especially in cold conditions, along with a stiff gait and weight shifting.
