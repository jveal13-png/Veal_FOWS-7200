Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The image arrangement illustrates the relationship between the three key factors in epidemiology or disease transmission.

![1. Sample Size for 5% Prevalence, 95% Confidence, 5000 Deer](images/clipboard-1592867622.png)

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence with 95% confidence in a herd of 5000 deer is 82.

2\. Sample Size Comparisons (Hypergeometric, "Infinite" or Large Population)

a\) 95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 299.

b\) 99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 229.

3\. Interpreting a Sample of 300 Deer from 4000 (None Positive, 95% Confidence)

From the table (95% confidence, population size 4000):

\- Sampled: 300 deer, None positive.

\- For 1% prevalence, required sample: 118.

\- For 0.5% prevalence, required sample: 230.

Since 300 exceeds 118 but is just above 230, and all are negative, the maximum prevalence is \<0.5% (less than 0.5%) at 95% confidence.

Herd size at risk: 56 elk

Daily Counts Calculation

For each date: - Prevalence: Number of elk with any sign of infection (RE, OD, or both) on that day. - Incidence: Number of elk that became newly affected (first day with RE or OD) on that date.

Tally of Affected Elk Per Day

1.  Incidence on 06/12/25, 06/14/25, 06/15/25 (with units):

-   Incidence= (Number of new cases on given day) / (Population at risk)
-   For 06/12/25: 4/56 = 0.071 or 7.1%
-   For 06/14/25: 1/56 = 0.018 or 1.8%
-   For 06/15/25: 0/56 = 0 or 0%

2.  Prevalence on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25 (with units):

-   Prevalence = (Number infected on day) / (Population)
-   For 06/13/25: 10/56 = 0.179 or 17.9%
-   For 06/16/25: 7/56= 0.125 or 12.5%

3.  Day When Prevalence = Incidence (numeric equality, different units):

-   06/10/25: Both are 1 (incidence/new case and prevalence/total affected). The units differ:
-   Prevalence: 1 elk currently infected
-   Incidence: 1 new case
-   As a percentage: 1/56= 0.018 or 1.8% for both (numeric equality but unit is 'new cases' vs. 'current infected').

4.  Which Day Had the Lowest Incidence?

-   06/15/25: Zero new cases
