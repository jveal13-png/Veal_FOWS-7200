Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The image arrangement illustrates the relationship between the three key factors in epidemiology or disease transmission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![1. Sample Size for 5% Prevalence, 95% Confidence, 5000 Deer](images/clipboard-1592867622.png)

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence with 95% confidence in a herd of 5000 deer is 82.

2\. Sample Size Comparisons (Hypergeometric, "Infinite" or Large Population)

a\) 95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 299.

b\) 99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 229.

3\. Interpreting a Sample of 300 Deer from 4000 (None Positive, 95% Confidence)

From the table (95% confidence, population size 4000):

\- Sampled: 300 deer, None positive.

\- For 1% prevalence, required sample: 288

\- For 0.5% prevalence, required sample: 230.

Since 300 exceeds 288, and all are negative, the maximum prevalence is \<0.5% (less than 0.5%) at 95% confidence.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

**Unit: Cases/population at risk (100 Elk per day)**

Incidence on **06/12/25**:

New cases: 5 Elk (2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B)

Population at risk: 51 Elk (56 total-5 cumulative cases on 06/11)

**Incidence Rate= 5/51= 0.09804 (9.8)**

Incidence on **06/14/25**:

New cases: 2 Elk (1766B, 4599B)

Population at risk: 44 Elk (56 total-12 cumulative cases on 06/13)

**Incidence Rate: 2/44= 0.04545 (4.5)**

Incidence on **06/15/25**:

New cases: 0 Elk

Population at risk: 42 Elk (56 total-14 cumulative cases on 06/14)

**Incidence Rate= 0/42= 0 (0)**

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 6/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit of prevalence.

Prevalence= (Total affected cases on day t / Total population on day t) x 100

Prevalence on 06/13/25:

Total affected cases (**I** 06/13):12 Elk (06/13)

Total Population(**N**): 56 Elk

**Prevalence: 12/56= 0.21428 (21.43% per 100)**

Prevalence on 06/16/25:

Total affected cases (06/16):5 Elk (06/13)

Total Population: 56 Elk

**Prevalence: 5/56= 0.08928 (8.93% per 100)**

c\) On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?

It is the same on the first day 06/10/25 so all new infection cases are new.

d\) On which day is the incidence the lowest?

The incidence rate is lowest on 06/15 and 06/16 since the new cases where at 0 on both days.
