The image arrangement illustrates the relationship between the three key factors in epidemiology or disease transmission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![1. Sample Size for 5% Prevalence, 95% Confidence, 5000 Deer](images/clipboard-1592867622.png)

The sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence with 95% confidence in a herd of 5000 deer is 82.

2\. Sample Size Comparisons (Hypergeometric, "Infinite" or Large Population)

a\) 95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 299.

b\) 99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population

The necessary sample size is 229.

3\. Interpreting a Sample of 300 Deer from 4000 (None Positive, 95% Confidence)

From the table (95% confidence, population size 4000):

\- Sampled: 300 deer, None positive.

\- For 1% prevalence, required sample: 288

\- For 0.5% prevalence, required sample: 230.

Since 300 exceeds 288, and all are negative, the maximum prevalence is \<0.5% (less than 0.5%) at 95% confidence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25, 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

**Unit: Cases/population at risk (100 Elk per day)**

Incidence on **06/12/25**:

New cases: 5 Elk (2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B)

Population at risk: 51 Elk (56 total-5 cumulative cases on 06/11)

**Incidence Rate= 5/51= 0.09804 (9.8)**

Incidence on **06/14/25**:

New cases: 2 Elk (1766B, 4599B)

Population at risk: 44 Elk (56 total-12 cumulative cases on 06/13)

**Incidence Rate: 2/44= 0.04545 (4.5)**

Incidence on **06/15/25**:

New cases: 0 Elk

Population at risk: 42 Elk (56 total-14 cumulative cases on 06/14)

**Incidence Rate= 0/42= 0 (0)**

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 6/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit of prevalence.

Prevalence= (Total affected cases on day t / Total population on day t) x 100

Prevalence on 06/13/25:

Total affected cases (**I** 06/13):12 Elk (06/13)

Total Population(**N**): 56 Elk

**Prevalence: 12/56= 0.21428 (21.43% per 100)**

Prevalence on 06/16/25:

Total affected cases (06/16):5 Elk (06/13)

Total Population: 56 Elk

**Prevalence: 5/56= 0.08928 (8.93% per 100)**

c\) On which day is the prevalence the same as the incidence (except the units)?

It is the same on the first day 06/10/25 so all new infection cases are new.

d\) On which day is the incidence the lowest?

The incidence rate is lowest on 06/15 and 06/16 since the new cases where at 0

Worksheet 4

1\. MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations.

This is incorrect. MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people, primarily from infected dromedary camels. Human-to-human transmission occurs only through close contact and has not sustained itself within human populations.

2\. Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV  

This is correct. Dromedary camels are the primary reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV, shedding virus in nasal secretions and acting as the main source for zoonotic spillover.

3\. Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV  

This is mostly correct. Phylogenetic and epidemiological data show that humans act as dead-end hosts, as transmission chains end quickly with no sustained community spread.

4\. The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%  

This is incorrect. The actual case fatality rate averages about 35% worldwide, as reported by the WHO, CDC, and recent epidemiological analyses.

5\. The epidemic curve shows a point source outbreak  

This is incorrect. MERS-CoV is characterized by repeated zoonotic spillovers from camels with limited human-to-human transmission, a propagated pattern rather than a single point source.

6\. Global MERS cases have declined sharply since 2019  

This is correct. Global MERS-CoV case reports have sharply decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily due to pandemic mitigation measures, reduced travel, and enhanced infection control. Additional factors may include changes in camel-human interaction and potential cross-immunity effects with SARS-CoV-2.

Worksheet 5

**Classification Under the Fenton and Pedersen Framework**

The Fenton and Pedersen community epidemiology framework classifies disease threats based on between- and within-species transmission rates, demarcating four categories: spillover, apparent multihost, true multihost, and potential emerging infectious disease.

Spillover event occurs when a pathogen occasionally transmits from a reservoir host, like bats, into a target population (humans), but cannot sustain human-to-human transmission:  R_0 \< 1 in humans.

Emerging infectious disease (EID) designation is warranted when, after initial spillover, sustained human-to-human transmission occurs within the target host (R_0 \> 1 in humans), resulting in broader community spread.

**Measures to Reduce Transmission Risk**

Contact tracing and isolation: Promptly trace contacts and isolate symptomatic individuals. 

Surveillance and diagnostics: Rapidly detect, test, and report cases. 

Vaccination/therapeutics: Use experimental vaccines or treatments under emergency protocols when available.

Healthcare Settings: Follow strict IPC measures, ensure staff training, maintain surge capacity with adequate supplies and advanced care, monitor healthcare workers for exposure, and establish safe patient movement protocols. Rwanda’s swift, evidence-based response—including IPC, vaccination trials, and health system mobilization—shows the effectiveness of these strategies for future filovirus outbreaks.

**Worksheet 7**

Nipah Virus—Malaysia vs. Bangladesh

In Malaysia, Nipah virus transmission primarily occurred from fruit bats to pigs, with humans infected by direct contact with infected pigs during farm operations or slaughter (Azri Bin Adzhar, 2011; NCBI, 2007). Minimal-to-no human-to-human transmission was observed (NCBI, 2007; CDA, 2025). In contrast, Bangladesh sees direct transmission from bats to humans, mainly via ingestion of raw date palm sap contaminated by bat saliva or urine (NCBI, 2007; CIDRAP, 2025). Significant human-to-human transmission has also been documented in Bangladesh, often through close contact with infected patients' secretions, especially saliva (NCBI, 2007; CIDRAP, 2025).

Preventive Measures: In Malaysia, controls focus on restricting pig movement, culling infected livestock, and improving farm biosecurity to limit bat–pig–human transmission (Azri Bin Adzhar, 2011; NCBI, 2007). In Bangladesh, strategies aim to minimize human exposure to contaminated palm sap (using collection covers, avoiding fresh sap consumption), encourage safe food handling, and isolate patients to limit person-to-person spread (NCBI, 2007; CIDRAP, 2025; WOAH, 2021).

Avian Reovirus

Avian reovirus (ARV) is transmitted both vertically (parent to offspring via eggs) and horizontally (bird-to-bird: fecal-oral, respiratory, contaminated feed/equipment) (ScienceDirect, 2025; Nature, 2016; GD Animal Health, n.d.). Environmental factors favoring ARV spread include high density, poor sanitation, contaminated surfaces/water, and stress—since the virus survives well on surfaces and in water (GD Animal Health, n.d.; ScienceDirect, 2025). ARV’s resilience in the environment, resistance to desiccation, and high shedding through feces support robust horizontal transmission (ScienceDirect, 2025; Nature, 2016; GD Animal Health, n.d.). A classic example is viral arthritis (tenosynovitis) in wild/domestic birds, causing lameness, joint swelling, reduced mobility, high mortality, and reduced egg production (Nature, 2016; PMC, 2022).

Langya Henipavirus (LayV)

The likely reservoir of Langya virus in China is shrews (genus Crocidura) with presumed animal-to-human transmission, likely via direct contact (PMC, 2022; Nature, 2025). Langya is classified as a spillover, not a potential EID, because all known human cases were directly traced to animal exposure and no sustained human-to-human transmission was observed (PMC, 2022; Nature, 2025).
